test1 - test with cst load varying between min and max production and yearly production that varies

test2.1 - test with cst load varying  between mind and max and sinusoidal res generation

test2.2 - I vary the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal
    nothing changes, the shape of the costs and LCOS curves with respect to LOAD% is always the same

test2.3 - I vary the frequency

test2.4 - single test with load set equal to minimum sinusoidal generation: bes should be zero

        The size of the bes is indeed zero -> it is correct but it does not match with the results of test 2.1

test3.1 - test with RES_factor varied so that the max/average of the yearly res production goes from 0 to 100% of load
    ["test3_res_max.xlsx" -> test made varying with respect to max of res]
    ["test3_res_max.xlsx" -> test made varying with respect to max of res]

test3.2 - I increased the RES_factor until the minimum of the renewable generation reached the value of the cosntant load (10MW):
        I would expect the size of the battery to be zero as no energy needs to be stored because all the load should be supplied by the RES
        The size of the battery is indeed zero
