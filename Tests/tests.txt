test1 - test with cst load varying between min and max production and yearly production

test2.1 - test with cst load varying  between mind and max and sinusoidal res generation
    The results did not seem to make sense because I was not considering that the diesel generator has
    installation costs that are influential in the optimization. 
    The installation costs of DG are actually not that influential.
    The influential factors are more likely other parameters such as fuel price, float life of the battery, installation cost of battery


test2.2 - I vary the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal
    nothing changes, the shape of the costs and LCOS curves with respect to LOAD% is always the same

test2.3 - I vary the frequency

test2.4 - single test with load set equal to minimum sinusoidal generation: bes should be zero

        The size of the bes is indeed zero -> it is correct but it does not match with the results of test 2.1

test2.5 - test with the cst load set as maximum of the sinusoidal generation and varying the fuel price
        After a certain fuel price the power and energy ratings of stuff don't change
        They have distinct formulas:
        For 
            P_prod(t) = A + B*sin(2pi/T*t)
            P_load(t) = (A+B)*C
        we have that
            Pr_BES = B 
            Er_BES = \integral_0^(T/2){P_prod(t)-A}dt = B*T/pi
            P_BES(t) = -B*sin(2pi/T*t)
            P_dg(t) = P_load(t) - A = (A+B)*C - A
test3.1 - test with RES_factor varied so that the max/average of the yearly res production goes from 0 to 100% of load
    ["test3_res_max.xlsx" -> test made varying with respect to max of res]
    ["test3_res_max.xlsx" -> test made varying with respect to max of res]

test3.2 - I increased the RES_factor until the minimum of the renewable generation reached the value of the cosntant load (10MW):
        I would expect the size of the battery to be zero as no energy needs to be stored because all the load should be supplied by the RES
        The size of the battery is indeed zero
    
test4.1 - to check if simulating for shorter time horizon (with the sinusoidal eneratino and the constant load) wuold affect the results
        -> it does not affect the results

test4.1bis - to check if simulating for shorter time horizon with real production affects the results

test4.2 - to check how much slower is the dispatcher if I implement all the constraints of the DG
        ->

test4.3 - to check how for varying optimization horizons how much does having constraints for the DGS affect the computational time

test_dispatcher_dsctd_try - to try the new version of the dispatcher which has the discounted objective function
        it works

test5.1 - to check how the system behave if I implement an objective function which penalizes the system when the battery is not fully charged, with the 
          use of a weight that varies between 0 and 1

TEST6
 testGA_DoD - first test in which te GA has three variables, capacity rating power rating and DoD of the battery
